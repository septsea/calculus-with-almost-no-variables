\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I owe a huge debt
to many organizations and people
that directly or indirectly provided me
with their assistance.

I thank the Comprehensive \hologo{TeX} Archive Network.
I thank \hologo{TeX} Live.

To be continued.

Finally, I give my special thanks to someone
unable to name anything
for the Hosimiya Sio decoration
and some other presents in the three-dimensional world,
which really brightened me when I felt depressed.
